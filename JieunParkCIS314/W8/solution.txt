A. What is the total number of memory writes? It may help to think in terms of movl instructions.
-> Writes 4 times and i and j runs 16 times for each.
So the total number of writes is 16*16*4=1024

B. What is the total number of memory writes that miss in the cache? 
-> 128
   Since 32 bytes blocks, there will be 2 miss when i =0 and j is from 0 to 16. So after sum up all i iteration for 4 writes, 16*2*4 = 128

C. What is the miss rate?
-> 128/1024 = 12.5%
