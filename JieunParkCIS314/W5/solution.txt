zProblem2:
See circuit.png.
 (A && !B) || (!C && D))
B and C have NOT gate, A and !B have AND gate, !C and D have AND gate,
AB and CD have OR gate

Problem3:
Fetch:
Read instruction from instruction memory
icode:ifun ← M1[PC]			//feches instruction
rA:rB ← M1[PC+1]			// feches rB ID
valC ← M4[PC+2]	 			// feches constant 
valP ← PC+6					// next PC value

Decode:
Read program registers
valB <-- R[rB] 				//read register rB

Execute:
Compute value or address
ValE <-- valB + ValC        //add constant and register rB
setCC						//set condition

Memory:
Read or write data       	//nothing

Write back:
Write program registers
R[rB] <- value 				//write back to rB

PC update:
PC <-- valP
